def percentage_change(old_value, new_value, multiply=True):
	"""
	Accepts two integers, an old and a new number, 
	and then measures the percent change between them.
	
	The chane between the two numbers is determined 
	and then divided into the original figure. 
	
	By default, it is then multiplied by 100, and 
	returning as a float.
	
	If you don't want the number multiplied by 100, 
	set the 'multiply' kwarg to False.
	
	If one of the numbers is zero, a null value is returned.
